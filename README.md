# Password-Checker
Done in Java: Create an application that will check for valid passwords

Create an application that will check for valid passwords.  The following rules must be followed to create a valid password.

1.	At least 6 characters long
2.	More than 10 characters is a strong password, between 6 and 10 characters is a weak (but acceptable) password.
3.	At least 1 numeric character
4.	At least 1 uppercase alphabetic character
5.	At least 1 lowercase alphabetic character
6.	No more than 2 of the same character in a sequence


When the application begins, the user will be presented with a screen that states the above instructions for creating a password, two text entry boxes for typing in a password, and three buttons.  
If the user wants to check a single password, they will type in the password in both boxes and select the “Check Password” button.
If the user wants to read in and check a list of passwords, they will select the “Check Passwords in File” button, be presented with a file explorer, and select the file to read from.  Those passwords that failed the check will be displayed, with their error message.
If the user presses the “Alt” key, a letter will be underlined in each button label.  That letter is the “mnemonic” that can used as a shortcut (Alt plus the letter) to execute the button.
If the user hovers his cursor over a button, a tooltip will be shown.
